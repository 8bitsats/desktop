# E2B Desktop Environment
This repo shows you how to run [E2B's sandboxes](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/overview) with graphical desktop-like environment. This allows you start applications like file explorers, browsers, terminals, notes, etc.

You can use PyAutoGUI to control the environment programmatically.

The desktop-like environment is based on Linux and [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org/) at the moment. We chose Xfce because it's the fastest one and with the lowest requirements out of the popular Linux desktop environments. Let us know if you need something else and Xfce doesn't work for you.

## Example
The [example script](python/example.py) in this repo does the following and takes a screenshot after each action:

**1. Start the sandbox with GUI**

Spawn a new sandbox and take a screenshot.

**2. Open the text editor**

Create a new file, write to the file, and open the file using Xfce's text editor called [mousepad](https://docs.xfce.org/apps/mousepad/start).

**3. Use PyAutoGUI**

Use PyAutoGUI to write new text in the text editor.

## Caveats

#### Use `desktop.screenshto()` instead of `pyautogui.screenshot()`
The official PythonAutoGUI's screenshot method doesn't capture the mouse pointer. If you want to take a screenshot with the mouse pointer, use our own implementation.
```py
from e2b_desktop import Desktop
desktop_sandbox = Desktop()
desktop_sandbox.screenshot("screenshot-name.png")
desktop_sandbox.close()
```

## How to run the example

**1. Install dependencies**

```bash
cd python && poetry install
```

**2. Add your E2B API key to the `python/.env` file**

**3. (Optional) Modify the script**

Modify the [`python/example.py`](python/example.py) file to do what you want â€” for example, to move the mouse to the coordinates (100, 150), you can add the following line to the `desktop.pyautogui(<code>)` call:

```python
pyautogui.moveTo(100, 150)
```

> Running `desktop.pyautogui(<code>)` multiple times is fine.

> You can use all the methods from the [E2B SDK](https://e2b.dev/docs/sandbox/overview) to interact with the desktop.

**4. Run the script**

```bash
poetry run python example.py
```

**5. Inspect the screenshots**

After the script finished, inspect the screenshots by checking them in the `python/` directory.

**6. (Optional) Modify the template**

If you want to preinstall dependencies you can modify the desktop template by editing the `template/*` files and then creating a [custom template](https://e2b.dev/docs/guide/custom-sandbox).

To spawn your custom sandbox, you need to pass the template name or ID to the constructor
```python
from e2b_desktop import Desktop

template_name_or_id = "my-sandbox-template"
desktop_sandbox = Desktop(template_name_or_id)
# ... perform actions in the sandbox
desktop_sandbox.close()
```
